## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to make the NIF field required?

Just add this to your theme's functions.php file (v3.0 and up):

`add_filter( 'woocommerce_nif_field_required', '__return_true' );`

### Is it possible to validate the check digit in order to ensure a valid Portuguese NIF/NIPC is entered by the customer?

Yes, it is! Just add this to your theme's functions.php file (v3.0 and up):

`add_filter( 'woocommerce_nif_field_validate', '__return_true' );`

We only recommend validating the NIF if your shop only sells to Portugal.

### Is this plugin compliant with the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?

First of all, it's the website owner responsibility to make your whole website compliant because no personal details whatsoever are transmitted to us, the plugin developers.
Anyway, we can help you by documenting how this plugin handles the collected data:

- The NIF/NIPC field is collected via the checkout process and stored as an order meta value, alongside with all the other WooCommerce order fields;
- The NIF/NIPC field can also be set on the "My Account - Billing Address" form and it's then stored as a user meta value, alongside with all the other WordPress and WooCommerce user fields;
- The NIF/NIPC field is shown and editable on the order edit and user edit screens on the backend, by the store owner;
- The NIF/NIPC field is shown on the order transactional emails;

### Is this plugin compatible with the new WooCommerce High-Performance order storage (COT)?

Yes.
